    : make sure that the number of colums and the number of values must be equal
  b. insert into table_name_1(col1, col2, col3, ..., colN) 
     select col1, col2, col3, ... , colN 
     from table_name_2 
     where 1=1 
     and condition1 = 'con1'
     and condition2 = 'con2'
  c. insert into table_name_1
     select col1, col2, col3, ... , colN 
     from table_name_2 
     where 1=1 
     and condition = 'con1'
     and condition2 = 'con2'
      : this type of sql inserts all columns of table_name_1, so must be the number of select columns must be equal to the table_name_1

2. update

     and table_name_condition2 = 'col2'
     
3. delete

     where 1=1
     and condition1 = 'col1'
     and condition2 = 'col2'
      : before deleting datas, make sure that the datas that will be deleted must be the intended ones
        , by implementing a query(select from table_name where 1=1 and condition1 = 'col1' and condition2 = 'col2')
